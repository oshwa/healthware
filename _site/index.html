            <h2 style="border:none">The Open Healthware Conference brings together medical and open source professionals working on creating accessible and open hardware.</h2>
               <p> Help us shape the Open Source Healthware Community by joining us at the Healthware community meetings. The Open Healthware OSE (Open Source Ecosystem) initiative seeks to unify the open-source hardware and healthcare communities by making designs for healthcare integration publicly available. The initiative will create a community agreed-upon standard for health-related open hardware projects. Hardware that meets that standard will be included in a new health-specific certification repository. This new certification will complement OSHWAâ€™s existing open hardware certification. We invite the community to help shape the future of Open Healthware through this process.
